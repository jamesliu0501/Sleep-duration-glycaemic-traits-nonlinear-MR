# Sleep-duration-glycaemic-traits-nonlinear-MR
This repository contains the major R scripts of the study, "Short sleep duration has a causal role in type 2 diabetes: evidence from non-linear Mendelian randomization"

One is the R script of the nonlinear Mendelian randomization applying localized estimation approaches (i.e., doubly-ranked stratification and residual stratification) adopting a semiparametric method (i.e., piecewise linear method (PLM)). 

The another file contains the R script of the approximation of the clinical implications.
